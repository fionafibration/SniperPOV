# SniperPOV


By default, in a POV demo, TF2 makes the local sniper invisible when you scope in. This is a small loader that fixes that. 
Meant to be used alongside HLAE.

Usage: 

Launch TF2 and inject HLAE, either through HLAE's custom loader, or through Lawena. Then run injector.exe. Or your own injector.
It will require running as admin if your TF2 is.

## DO NOT RUN WITHOUT INSECURE MODE

This project injects into Team Fortress 2, and is not obfuscated at all. 
Using this without -insecure mode will probably get you VAC banned. 

## Updates

This should be pretty stable for TF2 updates but if it breaks please make an issue, and I'll try to fix it as soon as I can.
