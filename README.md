# SniperPOV


By default, in a POV demo, TF2 makes the local sniper invisible when you scope in. This project fixes that. 
Meant to be used alongside HLAE.

Usage: 

Launch TF2 and inject HLAE, either through HLAE's custom loader, or through Lawena. Then run injector.exe. 
It will require running as admin if your TF2 is.

## DO NOT RUN WITHOUT INSECURE MODE

This project injects into Team Fortress 2, and is not obfuscated at all. 
Using this without -insecure mode will probably get you VAC banned.
